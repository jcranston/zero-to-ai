Zero to AI is an educational python project designed to teach the basics of
working in unix as well as writing python for those that have never done either.
The project culminates in implementing some AI algorithms.

This course is developed from the "ground up", meaning that I will be writing
documentation as I write assignments while working with students of the course
directly. I intend this for this course to not so much stand on its own in
isolation (though if it can do so, that's fantastic). Rather, I intend to use
the materials in this project in conjunction with one-on-one face time
interaction. Not only do I value face-to-face collaboration, but it also helps
give me direct insight into how to best tweak the materials here to best serve
students.

This course assumes no formal background in coding, computer science, linear
algebra, or statistics. The assignments are meant to "hand-hold" through
specially curated projects that draw from educational moments in a standard
computer science curriculum, as well as key elements from linear algebra and
statistics courses. Ultimately, working in artificial intelligence requires a
fluency between the right tools, computer science fundamentals, and statistics
in a multivariate case.

Specifically, we'll learn the following concepts together:

- what an operating system (OS), including file systems and syscalls
- what the difference between a shell and terminal is
- what the difference between Unix, Linux, macOS, and Darwin are
- a brief history into the development of "Unix-Like" operating systems
- POSIX compliance
- the basics of python and the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language
- the basics of C, x86, the stack, heap, disk, and the GNU Compiler Collection (``gcc``)
- basic POSIX-shell directives like ``pwd``, ``mkdir``, etc.
- an introduction to networking including ``curl``, ``ssh``, ``scp``, etc.
- uniform resource locators (URLs) and the basic concepts behind the modern-day cloud, including what an API is, REST, HTTP(S), and IP
- python types, variables, assignments
- control flow as introduced via the python language spec and parallels to C-like languages
- ... TODO fill the rest out later
