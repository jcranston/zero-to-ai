# Getting Started as a Student

_"He who chases two rabbits catches neither."_ -Confucius

## Introduction

Welcome! I wrote this course with the goal of introducing Python, Unix shell,
and basic concepts in AI for people without any background in any of these
concepts.

Getting started working in this environment can be intimidating, as there are
a lot of new concepts to work with. For the sake of efficiency, I am going to
introduce specific concepts in a pedantic way so you can set up your Python
environment quickly and start working on the assignments, as opposed to
getting bogged down learning about a specific setup requirement.

Where appropriate, I will link to existing documentation and instructional material
if you are curious to learn more. To keep this project lean, I'm going to first
focus on the "steel thread" necessary for you to start working on `assign0`,
making code commits in git, and then finally the mechanics involved in
submitting your assignment. Please focus on this as your end-goal, as opposed
to getting distracted learning all about Conda or git. You will learn more
about these tools over time. They are very powerful, but can be distracting,
and the reality is that we will only be using a small subset of commands from
each tool.

## Machine Requirements

This project is written for students using a Linux or Mac operating system.
There are no specific hardware requirements.

## Setup Process:

The details for getting set up to work on assignments in `zero-to-ai` are
documented in the following pages. Please follow these instructions in order,
by following the instructions on each page to completion:

1. [The Command Line](./command-line.md)
1. [Create a Github Account](./create-github-account.md)
1. [Codebase Installation](./codebase-install.md)
1. [Pycharm Installation](./pycharm-install.md)
1. [Conda Installation](./conda-install.md)
1. [Setup your `assign0` Conda Environment](./activate-conda-env.md)
1. [Build the Zero-to-AI Documentation](./build-z2ai-documentation.md)

Please note, specific documentation for each assignment will only be available
once you complete the last step as defined above, so it is important to follow
the setup process to completion.
