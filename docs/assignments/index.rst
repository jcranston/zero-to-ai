==================

This is the landing page for all documentation related to the assignments.

    zero-to-ai/python/test

for source code and tests, respectively.

The Python assignments here are going to mirror the content of `CS41 <https://stanfordpython.com/>`_
at Stanford. Feel free to navigate to the lecture material on the CS41 website
and follow along withe slides for more information. At times, the methods you
will implement will also diverge from CS41 and bring in concepts from other
aspects of a CS curriculum, with a particular application to statistics and
linear algebra (since we're learning AI algorithms!).

Assignments are meant to be completed sequentially. A successful assignment
completion involves:

1. A correctly executing `make` target for the assignment, i.e.::

    make test-assign0
