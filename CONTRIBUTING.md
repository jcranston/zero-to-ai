# Contributing

When contributing to this repository as a curriculum developer, please first
discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with
James Cranston before create a feature request branch. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your
interactions with the project.

## Merge Request Process for Curriculum Contributions

1. Please create a feature branch for your update in the following format:
    ```
    <github username>/contributing/<short description>
    ```
    As an example:
    ```
    jcranston/contributing/update-project-documentation
    ```
   Naming branches in this format will ensure they do not get picked up by the
   CI pipeline, which is used to test student feature branches written by
   students working on the assignments.
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the
layer when doing a build.
1. When applicable, update the README.md with details of changes to the
interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file
locations and container parameters. Please also update all relevant
documentation under `docs`. Merge requests without supplemental documentation
or documentation changes will be rejected.
1. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the
new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we
use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
1. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign off from James
Cranston through formal code review. If you do not have permission to do that,
you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
